_ANLY 580 (Fall 2020) Project #2_

**Introduction**<br>
Since its introduction in 2006, Twitter has evolved into a key platform for modern politics–offering politicians a fast and easy way to communicate their message and priorities to the public. Under the Trump administration, Twitter continued to grow even more central to politics as the President often chose his Twitter account as the preferred medium for connecting with the American people. Twitter’s popularity as a medium for political discourse means that information from political campaigns--everything from campaign events to fundraising to policy platforms--is readily available in real-time. The 2020 Democratic Presidential Primaries were no different. At one point more than two dozen candidates vied for the opportunity represent the Democratic Party in the 2020 Presidential Election. This project examined the tweets made by seven of the most prominent candidates, from the start of August 2019 until Super Tuesday (March 2020), to understand how each candidate used this growing platform to engage prospective voters.
